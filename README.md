# Whack-A-Blob
Created using Scala, JavaFX and ScalaFX. A simplistic way of describing the game is to click the circles as fast as possible to accumulate a score before the timer expires.

The src and build.sbt files are located in the file as well.
Please note that my program utilizes the DERBY database for the scores.
